### Welcome!

Feel free to reach out [via email](mailto://golgothasTerror101@gmail.com), say hello and whatnot.

Currently hacking on:
- [Servo](https://github.com/servo/servo/): a Rust browser engine whose components have found their way into Firefox a few times,
- [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/): a C# video game about mundane jobs and betrayal in space,
  and
- an unannounced video game title ðŸ¤«.

I've recently been using [typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) to format meeting minutes instead of markdown, and enjoying it.
